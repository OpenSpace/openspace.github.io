This rendering code was created to visualize satellites in earth orbit.  The precise position of each satellite above the Earth is rendered according to the date & time.  The Two-Line Element set (TLE) file format is a standard for defining satellite orbital mechanics.  It contains all of the necessary Keplerian elements to define an orbital path.  When running the satellites module, OpenSpace reads all of the provided TLE files and generates a renderable for each entry.

See the Users/Content/Satellites [page](../users/content/satellites.md) for basic instructions on how to select satellites to view, and start OpenSpace with this content.

## Automation
OpenSpace features like regular expressions and keyboard bindings can be used to automate control of satellite layers.  Keyboard bindings can be added to an individual scene.  For example, in the `preInitialization` function of the file `default.scene`, the following `bindkey` command can be added:
```
    openspace.bindKey("p", "openspace.setPropertyValue(
                    'stations_*.renderable.Enabled', false)",
                    "Disable stations visibility")
```
The **\*** wildcard will apply the command to all renderables that meet the `stations_*` criteria in this case.  Regular expression syntax can also be used. When running OpenSpace, press _p_ to make all station satellites invisible.  Specific commands can also be entered in the terminal at runtime, without pre-configuring a scene file.  Press **\`** to get a terminal at the top of the window, and type: `openspace.setPropertyValue('stations_*.renderable.Enabled', true)`, and then all satellites from the `stations.txt` TLE file will become visible again.

## Customizing the Satellites Module
When OpenSpace starts the satellites module, it tries to download `.tle` files that are specified in the `data/assets/scene/solarsystem/planets/earth/satellites/satellites.asset` file.  At the top of this file, `satelliteGroups` contains a dictionary entry for each .tle file to be included in the visualization.  Each file has a `title` for its description, a `url` for where to download the latest .tle file, and a `trailColor`.  Further down in this file, the `UrlSynchronization` type is used to tell OpenSpace to download a copy from the URL specified (this is done for best orbital accuracy, since some satellite positions are updated often).  After downloading, OpenSpace will open each file and read all of the satellite entries that it contains (two lines for each satellite TLE entry).  For each TLE entry, OpenSpace computes the current orbital position and generates a renderable object.  If a large number of satellites are listed, then the initialization time as well as the rendering performance may be negatively impacted.

## Adding new Satellite Data to OpenSpace
OpenSpace can render satellites that have a periodic orbit that is defined in the TLE format. To add a new data TLE source, a new .asset file can be created by using other similar files as inspiration. Setting the `url` field mentioned above to the online source for the data will prompt OpenSpace to download the file each time it starts.
For other types of solar system objects, such as asteroids, comets, or small solar system bodies, see some of the other [Ephemeris](../builders/ephemeris/index.md) wiki pages.

## Selectively Rendering Individual Satellites in a Group
The satellite rendering software groups satellites together by category, and any change to that category (e.g. visibility, trail color, trail length) affects all of them simultaneously.
There is an advanced method for limiting the satellites rendered within a group. By selecting Scene -> Solar System -> Planets -> Earth -> Satellites, the different satellite groups can be seen. Underneath a satellite group, expand the Renderable category to see slider controls for "Starting Index of Render" and "Size of Render Block". The Starting Index selects which satellite to start rendering (the previous satellites will be hidden), and the Size controls how many are rendered starting from the index. The size can be set to 1 or more satellites. When the Starting Index is set to a non-zero value, an info message containing the name & description of that satellite will be added to the OpenSpace log.html file.
