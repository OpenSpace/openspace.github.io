This page goes through everything that should be known about the globe browsing feature in OpenSpace.  This page is both for content creators and for developers but I will try to separate the text so that it is a bit easier to follow.

## For Users
- [Navigation]({{ site.url }}/docs/users/globebrowsing/navigation) Basics in navigating the camera using keyboard and mouse as well as script functions.  Also descriptions in navigating through time.
- [Working With Layers]({{ site.url }}/docs/users/globebrowsing/working-with-layers) Description of handling layers for renderable globes.

## Builders
- [Creating a Renderable Globe]({{ site.url }}/docs/builders/globebrowsing/creating-a-renderableglobe) This page describes what settings are possible when building a renderable globe using a Lua table for the renderable.
- [Readable Datasets]({{ site.url }}/docs/builders/globebrowsing/readable-datasets) A summation of the dataset types that can be read and used for globe layers.
- [Build Local DEM Patches to Load With OpenSpace]({{ site.url }}/docs/builders/globebrowsing/build-local-dem-patches) A tutorial describing how to preprocess local patches so that they can be read as layer datasets.
