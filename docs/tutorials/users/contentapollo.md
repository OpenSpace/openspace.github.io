## Overview
The Apollo profile contains content for Apollo 8, 11 and 17. Each mission has various parts to it based on what data was able to be compiled. While not consistant across the missions, each mission has some key data that can be used to explain the overall mission. Apollo 8's trip to the moon and it's famous Eartrise moment can be recreated. For Apollo 11 you can fly along with the Eagle during the last few minutes of it's decent up to landing. On Apollo 17, the three day mission is laid out with a series of maps from the USGS, and if your computer has enough available resources, you can add additional 3D models of boulders sampled by the astronauts at 3 different locations. 

## Included Content
 - `Mission Insignia Map` - A set of markers for the apollo landing sites. Each marker hovers above the moon surface above the landing location and displays the mission patch. 
 - `Apollo 11 flipbook` - A series of hires images of the apollo 11 landing site taken with different sun angles on the landing site. Flipping through the images shows the site with varying contrast, highlighting different details in each frame. 
 - `Apollo 8 Orbits` - Three orbits for Apollo 8 are included, with different frames of reference.
 - `Apollo 8 Capsule` - A model of the Apollo capsule is positioned based on ephemeris.
 - `Apollo 11 Orbits` - Orbits for the Apollo 11 CSM and LM included from time of separation down to landing.
 - `Apollo 11 HiRes Strip` - High resolution color and height layers for the Apollo 11 landing site.
 - `Apollo 11 Lem` - A 3D model of the lem is located at the landing site. 
 - `Apollo 17 Trav Map` - A High resolution color layer diagraming the Apollo 17 mission. "The map includes nomenclature, elevation contours, the astronauts' major geology stops, and rover traverses".
 - `Apollo 17 Station Insets` - High resolution inset maps with legends for each station visited during Apollo 17.
 - `Apollo 17 Lem` - A 3D model of the lem is located at the landing site.
 - `Apollo 17 HiRes Strip` - High resolution color and height layers for the Apollo 17 landing site.
