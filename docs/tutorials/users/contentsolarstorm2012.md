# Profile - Bastille Day 2000
{: .no_toc }

This section will conver the content available in the 'bastilleday2000' profile and tips on how and when to use it in a presentation.

## Overview
The Bastille Day 2000 profile contains content for a solar event that happened on July 14, 2000 know as the 'Bastille Day solar storm' ([Wiki Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastille_Day_solar_storm) ). 
The content in this profile visualizes the event by showing the coronal mass ejection from the sun the visulized with a volumetric representing plansma density, fieldlines representing the magnetic field, and fluxnodes that visualize the intensity of a particle that is traced along the magnetic field.

When presenting this content, we find it best to use the provided loops, and only a subset of the visualizations at a time. For example, when close to the sun, you should disable the fluxnode cut planes. These details will be explained in the sections below.


The data in this profile comes from the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Community Coordinated Modeling Center ([https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/) ) and Predictive Science Inc. ([https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aab36d](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aab36d))


## Included Content
 - `Density Volume` - A volumetric rendering of plasma density during the event.
 - `Fieldlines` - Fieldlines tracing magnetic flux propeled by the event.
 - `Flux Nodes` - Nodes reprenseting protons traced along the magenetic fields. Colored by their energy level.
 - `Flux Node Cutplanes` - Animated equatorial and meridial cutplanes showing the energy dispersion of the event.
 - `Flux Node legend image` - Screenspace image with color bar/legend for flux node/cutplane colormap
 - `Speed of light indicator` - White particle traveling from the sun to earth at the speed of light, useful to visualize the rate of time when speeding up the rate of time.
 - `Sun Magnetogram` - A series of 3 magnetogram textures for the sun at varying intensities.
 - `Earth Magnetosphere` - A colorful represetation of the Earth's magnetosphere.
 - `EUV Layer` - A sphere that can be enabled around the sun, with an animated texure of an extreme ultra violet (EUV) simulation, during the CME.

## Fluxnodes and cutplanes
 - Fluxnode visuals change based on distance from sun:
    - Close to the sun, small dots are shown traced along the fieldlines.
    - At the solarsystem level, the fluxnode can be hard to understand but can be used to visualize the suns rotation aka Parker Spiral.
    - Turning off the fluxnodes and turning on the cutplanes can be used at the solar system level to show how far reaching the energy from the event is. Together both cutplanes infer a spherical volume.
 - For both the fluxnodes and the cutplanes, use the legend image to explain how the intensity of the energy disperses/changes.
