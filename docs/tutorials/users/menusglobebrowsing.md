# Using the Menus - Globebrowsing
{: .no_toc }

This section will cover the available functionality when exploring worlds in the Solar System.

## Globe Properties
 - As with any dataset in OpenSpace, globes have their own specific properties under Renderable in the Scene menu.
 - There are many infrequently used settings. The most commonly used ones are:
    - '_Labels_': Some globes have labels that can be turned on or off. Labels are a special property of a globe and have their own internal properties.
    - '_Layers_': See the sections about Layers below.
    - '_Perform Shading_': When enabled, this setting will darken the globe based on the Sun. See [Lighting Conditions](#lighting-conditions) for more details.
    - '_Use Accurate Normals_': Used in conjunction with the '_Perform Shading_' setting, this setting will use the enabled '_Height Layers_' to further adjust the lighting conditions.
    - '_Eclipse_': To see an eclipse happen on a globe, you must enable this setting.
    - '_Eclipse Hard Shadows_': Used with the '_Eclipse_' setting, this setting will disable the smoothing at the edges of the eclipse sections.
    - '_Target Level of Detail Scale Factor_': This setting will adjust the level of detail that is loaded for maps in relation to the distance to the camera.
        - Lower values will make the map load faster, and give better performance, at the cost of map resolution.
        - Higher values will take longer to load and negatively impact performance, but will give a more detailed overall image.

## Layers and Their Settings
 - Without layers, the globe will be just a gray sphere.
 - The layers of a globe are organized into categories.
    - '_ColorLayers_' are used to add maps and other visual information to the globe.
    - '_HeightLayers_' are used to deform the globe, sometimes referred to as a _Digital Elevation Model_
    - Some globes will have other special groups such as '_Overlays_' or '_WaterMasks_' on Earth.
 - The layers of a globe can be turned on or off by using the checkbox next to their name.
    - Enabled layers will be tinted with the highlight color.
 - Adjust the settings of a layer by clicking to open its submenu.
    - For ColorLayers, use the _Opacity_, _Gamma_, and _Multiplier_ settings to change the way the layer appears.
    - For HeightLayers, use the _Gamma_ and _Multiplier_ settings to exaggerate the elevation. This can sometimes lead to unexpected rendering issues.
    - For HeightLayers, the _Offset_ can be used to elevate one heightmap relative to another.

## Layer Ordering and Blending
 - The order of the layers in the menu represents the order that they are wrapped over the globe, like the layers of an onion.
   - The last layer in the menu list will appear as the outermost layer of the globe.
   - The first layer in the menu would be the innermost layer.
 - If multiple global layers are enabled, only the outermost one will be visible.
   - This becomes important when combining different maps that are multi-color/monochromatic or global/regional.
   - If a layer is monochromatic, its '_Blend Mode_' can be set to '_Color_' and its pixels will inherit the color values of the layer underneath it.
 - Regional layers must appear lower in the menu than global layers in order to combine them.

## Lighting Conditions
 - By default, globes will have the '_Perform Shading_' setting enabled, and thus will be lit based on their rotation and position relative to the Sun. To light a different part of the globe, you will need to move time forward or backward. See [Using the Menus - Time](/docs/tutorials/users/menustime)
 - For times when you don't want to change the simulation time, you can disable the '_Perform Shading_' property of the globe.
 - If you want the globe to be brighter even when not shaded, try increasing the '_Multiplier_' setting of the innermost layer as described above.

## Atmospheres
 - Venus, Earth, Mars, and Titan have an atmosphere attached to their globe. The atmosphere is a separate item in the scene menu.
 - The atmosphere will affect the lighting conditions on the globe, even if 'Perform Shading' is not enabled.
 - To always have the area of the globe you are looking at lit when an atmosphere is enabled, you must enable the '_Enable Sun on Camera Position_' setting for the globe's atmosphere along with disabling the '_Perform Shading_' setting on the globe.
 - The only other common settings to change in an atmosphere would be '_Enable Hard Shadows for Eclipes_' when you are trying to visualize an eclipse, or '_Sun Intensity_' if you wish to brighten or dim the overall lighting of a globe.

## Special Layers on Earth
 - The default layer on Earth is a special "combo layer" â€” this means that it is actually two layers that will fade from one to the other based on a specific tile level. The "_ESRI VIIRS COMBO_" fades between the "_VIIRS SNPP (Temporal)_" layer and the "_ESRI World Imagery Layer_."
 - Earth has special layers in the "Overlay" group that show country features/names, coastlines, and more.
 - Earth has a special NightLayers group since we create light that is visible on the dark side of the planet.
 - The portion of the Earth that would be darkened by the '_Perform Shading_' section is instead rendered with a different map depicting city lights as visible from space.
 - If you wish to show a fully lit Earth at any simulation time, you must disable any night layers.

| Video time | Description |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| 0:00 | Turn on and off the _Perform shading_ setting. |
| 0:22 | Turn on and off _Use Accurate Normals_ setting. |
| 1:39 | Turn on _Labels_ on the Moon, which appear as you zoom closer. The Labels size and colors can be adjusted in the submenu. |
| 2:24 | Turn on and off _ColorLayers_ and _HeightLayers_. |
| 3:51 | Earth's default combo layer "_ESRI VIIRS COMBO_" fades from the "_VIIRS SNPP (Temporal)_" layer to the "_ESRI World Imagery Layer_" when closer to the globe. This can be done manually using the opacity setting when both layers are enabled. |
| 4:58 | Earth's temporal layers, such as "_VIIRS SNPP (Temporal)_," will load as the date is changed. |
| 6:03 | Earth's _NightLayers_ appear on the part of the globe not lit by the Sun. |
| 6:38 | Earth has special _Overlays_ that, when enabled add annotations such the outline of countries. |
| 7:30 | Adjusting the lighting conditions on Mars. |
| 8:24 | Adjust the settings on Mars' _ColorLayers_ to change the way the layers appear. |
| 9:49 | Adjust the blending settings on Mars' _ColorLayers_ to change how multiple layers appear when enabled. |
