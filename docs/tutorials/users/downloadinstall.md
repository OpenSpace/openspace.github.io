## MacOS Folder Permissions
As shown in the video, most users will need to adjust the folder permissions on the installed OpenSpace folder, and "Apply to Enclosed Items" as outlined here by Apple: [https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-permissions-for-files-folders-or-disks-mchlp1203/mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-permissions-for-files-folders-or-disks-mchlp1203/mac)

## MacOS Installation "unidentified developer" error
If you try to launch OpenSpace and you get an error that the application is not registered with Apple by an identified developer, you can follow these steps from Apple to run OpenSpace anyway: [https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac)


## Open in Low Resolution Mode
For users running on a Retina display, you may want to apply the "Open in Low Resolution Mode" setting on the OpenSpace.app to get better performance.
