# Navigation: Controlling the Camera
{: .no_toc }

This section will cover controlling the camera in OpenSpace using a mouse and keyboard. A three-buttoned mouse is recommended for easiest use of OpenSpace.

1. TOC

## Rotation
 - Use the left mouse button and drag your mouse to rotate or orbit around your target.
 - The camera will rotate in the direction you drag.
 - How far you drag the mouse will be how fast the camera will move.

## Zoom
 - Use the right mouse button and drag to zoom closer or further away from your target.
 - Dragging down will zoom away, dragging up will zoom closer.
 - How far you drag the mouse will be how fast the camera will move.
 - To zoom quickly, press and hold the 'Z' key.

## Roll, Yaw, and Pitch
 - Hold the CTRL key while dragging with the left mouse button to yaw or pitch the camera.
 - Using the middle mouse button (depressing the scroll wheel) lets you roll the camera. If you do not have a third button, you can also roll the camera by holding the SHIFT key and dragging while pressing the left mouse button.

## Friction
 - By default, friction is enabled when controlling the camera, slowing the camera to a stop after you move it.
 - Friction can be toggled independantly for Rotation, Zoom, or Roll.
 - Click the words in the upper right on-screen dashbord to toggle the type of friction you want to change.
 - You can also toggle the friction for Rotation, Zoom, and Roll with the 'F', 'Shift+F' or 'Ctrl+F' keybinds, respectively.
