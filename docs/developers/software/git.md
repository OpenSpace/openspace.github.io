# Git software
OpenSpace uses Git submodules, which are not supported on all clients.  Xcode on Mac, for example, does not, so beware.
  - [Fork](https://git-fork.com) A pay-if-you-will Git client for both Windows and macOS
  - [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com) A free and powerful Git client usable on both Windows and macOS
  - [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com) A free GUI for Windows, macOS, and Linux
  - [SmartGit](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/) Another GUI Git client which runs on Windows and Mac
  - XCode does not support recursive cloning or git submodule commands.  However, installing Xcode makes Git available on the Terminal, which supports the `--recusive` flag

# Usage
[Learning Git](http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching) is a good, interactive webpage to learn the basics of using Git.
