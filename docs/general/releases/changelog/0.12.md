## Changelog
### Features
  - A pre-build binary for MacOS is included in the download section of the webpage
  - Added support for using joysticks and gamepads as input devices. The `data/assets/util/default_joystick.asset` controls the handling of connected joysticks
  - Bittorrent-based file synchronization has been completely removed in favor of HTTP-based synchronization. This change will fix the majority of issues that users had while synchronizing data in a firewalled environment
  - The `default.scene` will now by default start at "yesterday"s date and show the as-of-yet incomplete VIIRS image for "today" if the user jumps to "today"
  - The startup and shutdown times of the application has been overall lowered
  - **Potentially breaking change:**  The layout of the central `openspace.cfg` has been changed and users must adapt their old, modified variants for this release.  Mitigation consists of removing the `return {` and single `}` at the top and bottom of the file respectively
  - Added a mechanism to pass commandline arguments to OpenSpace that modify the loaded `openspace.cfg` to enable the setting of start-up scenes, SGCT configuration files and others from the commandline for clustered environments
  - When `PRINT_SCREEN` is creating a screenshot, it is now placed in the `screenshots/{current date}/` folder, rather than the `bin` folder as it was before
  - The default horizontal field-of-view has been changed to 80 degrees, which can be overwritten in the `openspace.cfg` file by the user by modifying the `sgct.config.single` parameters as described in the `scripts/configuration_helper.lua` file
  - When running OpenSpace in a windowed setup, manually changing the size of the window will now automatically adapt the aspect ratio that is used for the rendering
  - Added an inituial ability to automatically create focus markers on planets based on available `.info` files by editing the `data/assets/customization/globebrowsing.asset` file and changing `CreateFocusNodes` to `true`
  - Added the ability to use a single-file HTTP-based synchronization from third party locations. Examples of this are in the `data/assets/examples/urlsynchronization.asset`
  - It is now possible to zoom by using the left mouse button and pressing the Alt key in addition to using the right mouse button to support MacOS touch pads
  - Made it possible to click on the friction markers in the image to toggle the individual friction modes in addition to using the `F`, `Shift+F`, and `Ctrl+F` keyboard shortcuts
    - The `Global Properties -> Dashboard` now has a single property that will toggle its visibililty on screen
  - **Potentially breaking change:** The names of properties in the scene tree is now simplified and users must adapt their custom scripts to add a `Scene.` prefix to properties that change attributes of objects in the scene graph.
  - Added support for stb_image-based texture reader on non-Windows platforms

### Content
  - Added asset for the Messenger mission
  - Added Pluto to the default scene
  - Added Scaling node to all planets

### Bugfixes
  - Make the minimum skirt length of globes depenent on its radius to support small globes, such as moons of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn
  - Fix bug preventing Saturn's rings from rendering
  - Fix bug causing Kepler-based translation to use a wrong value for the semi-major axis
