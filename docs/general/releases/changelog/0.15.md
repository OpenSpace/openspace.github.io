# Beta-5 [0.15.0]
 - Version: 0.15.0
 - Date: 2019-09-17
 - Finished: [c3b481f1e9b340cda49147ce8c7eb2f99fc98f53](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace/commit/c3b481f1e9b340cda49147ce8c7eb2f99fc98f53)

## Changelog
### Features
 - Added a partially linearized rendering pipeline that enables support for High Dynamic Range objects. This feature also adds support for changing the exposure of the virtual camera, enable tweaking of saturation, hue, and brightness of the overall image
 - Added a new, preliminary, profile creator to easily select which assets are included and save these as `.scene` files
 - Added a preliminary feature to perform offline rendering, which has to be enabled through the Lua interface as of now. When calling
`openspace.sessionRecording.enableTakeScreenShotDuringPlayback(framerate)`, the next playback of a session recording will create a PNG file for each frame while playing back the session recording at the selected framerate
 - Added a new feature that enables the control of the camera through a WebSocket API.
 - Added a new rendering method that enables a more efficient rendering of satellite trails
 - Added the ability for the user to specify the location of the temporary folder, which now defaults to the OpenSpace/temp folder, rather than a global operating system specific folder that is used between multiple applications

### UI Improvements
 - Added a new user interface to add online screen space images
 - Added support for multiple endpoints in the WebGUI
 - Allow the user to abort the loading screen through the ESC key

### API
 - Replaced old setCameraState with new function setNavigationState that works more consistently when in orbit around a planet
 - Added support for arrays in LuaScript topics
 - Exposed the GlobeTranslation properties correctly

### Content
 - Added a volumetric representation of the milky way

### Content Creation
 - Added a new TimelineTranslation that interpolates between different Translations based on the in-game time
 - Added a new TimelineRotation that interpolates between different Rotations based on the in-game time

### Bugfixes

 - Drastically improved the performance and timing consistency of the Globebrowsing image loading
 - Used the more optimal `setPropertyValueSingle` instead of `setPropertyValue` Lua function in the `propertyHelper.invert` functions, which no longer causes unnecessary RegExp to be compiled
