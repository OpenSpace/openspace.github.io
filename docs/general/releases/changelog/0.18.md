## Breaking Changes
 - The height offset of a GlobeBrowsing height layer was calculated incorrectly before, causing a flip in the sign.  Before, an offset of 1000 would cause the terrain to be _lowered_ by 1000m, not _raised_ by 1000m as expected.  With this version, this bug is fixed, but it might require some adjustments in existing profiles. **Fix**: Invert the sign of all `*.Settings.Offset`s in scripts that apply to Height Maps
 - The organization of the NASA TREKs asset files has changed as the old method caused many users to get "too long path" errors on Windows.  **Fix**: Any user-created profile that uses the NASA Treks files needs to be manually updated.

## Features
### SkyBrowser
This feature brings high-resolution astronomical images from the [AAS Worldwide Telescope](https://worldwidetelescope.org) into OpenSpace. The location of a selected image is shown in the 3D view inside of OpenSpace.

### Camera paths (Fly-To)
This feature adds the ability to automatically fly the camera between different objects and between different navigation states. Currently, this feature only works when the time in OpenSpace is paused. A "Fly-to" or "Zoom-to" path will automatically pause the time and unpause it (if it was unpaused before) after completing the flight. Additionally, this feature enables the use of "Idle behaviors" that can either be triggered manually or by completing a Fly-to or Zoom-to flight that will make the camera do something interesting until the user interacts with the system again.
  - Adding procedurally generated camera paths (#1667)
  - Remove `OrbitalNavigator.LinearFlight` and instead add "Zoom to" helper functions (#1837)
  - Adding the ability to trigger an idle behavior for the camera after finishing a Fly-to or Zoom-to flight path (#1898)
    - Add an OrbitAroundUp IdleBehavior that rotates around the y-axis of the node instead of the z-axis
  - Automatically pause simulation time when starting a Fly-to or Zoom-to flight (#1832)

### Actions
Introducing "Actions" as first-class elements in OpenSpace to make repeatable changes. In prior versions it was possible to bin scripts to keybinds and use a "key-less keybind" to configure repeatable effects. The "Action" concept replaces this by encapsulating the changes in an Action and then provide the ability to bind a key to trigger an action instead. This also enables the reuse of "Actions" in other parts of the software. Older profiles that were made with previous version will be converted automatically on load with an Action identifier generated automatically.
  - Added Actions concept (#1708)

### Event System
Added a system that causes a specific list of events to be triggered automatically depending on the state in OpenSpace. This, for example, enables features to automatically fade an object's trial when flying closer to an object, but there are many more events that are defined in the system
 - Add implementation of the EventEngine to handle global event chains (#1741)

### User interface improvements
Various user interface improvements in the launcher and the in-game interface

#### Launcher
  - Add a new panel in the launcher used to create new SGCT configuration files.

  - Add ability in different Launcher panels to select profile properties from the ScriptLog of a previous OpenSpace run (#1780)
  - Explicitly sort file lists before showing them to the user in the Launcher and the Session recording which were presented non-alphabetically on MacOS (#1943)
  - Add the ability to choose the script from the ScriptLog in the ActionDialog and the additional script dialog including filtering and reloading the ScriptLog file (#2019)
  - Add warning to keybinding editor for duplicate assignments (#1461)

#### In-game
  - Add a new UI panel that shows a representation of the keyboard and all actions that are bound to keys
  - Add links to a tutorial page in the hamburger menu in the bottom left
  - Add UI elements that enables dynamic reordering of planetary layers
  - Add action dialog used to browse and trigger the available actions that are defined in the current scene
