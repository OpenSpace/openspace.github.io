# Features
  - Add the ability to customize the complexity of the user interface by choosing the visibility level of settings to determine how many of the properties are visible. The visibility settings can be set from the `openspace.cfg` file or by specifying an environment variable `OPENSPACE_LEVEL`. ([#166](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace/issues/166))
  - Toggling objects in the scene menu will now fade them in and out over a given time, rather than toggling them instantaneously. The default duration can be changed in the Setting / OpenSpace Engine / Fade Duration ([#1827](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace/issues/1827))
  - Add the ability to add videos to globes, sphere, and planes. The videos can be played back at their native speed or stretched to cover arbitrary time ranges. The `data/asset/examples/video` asset files include examples of how to use this feature. More information on this feature can be found [here]() ([#2608](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace/pull/2608))
  - A complete redesign of the documentation generated by OpenSpace. The new documentation now includes more information, is a lot easier to navigate, and includes links to other important sources of information. It can be found in the same location as before under `documentation/index.html` ([#2604](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace/pull/2604))
  - Include a new technique to display GeoJSON files on globes. This feature can be used to render line strips and polygons onto the surface of any planet. More information about this feature can be found [here]() ([#2595](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace/pull/2595))
  - Add a new GUI for ongoing missions that provides information about mission duration and milstones. This is a first step towards making mission profiles more accessible to users without prior knowledge ([#2603](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace/pull/2603))
  - Add a new user interface that can be toggled through the ... menu in the bottom right that is a Getting Started Tour to teach new OpenSpace users how the navigation system works and how to operate the different settings in the menus ([#2189](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace/pull/2189))
  - Replace the previous caching method for GlobeBrowsing layers with an MRF-based cache. This allows the caching of any remote layers locally on the computer. More information about this feature can be found [here]() ([#929](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace/issues/929))
  - Fade out stars and other objects in atmosphere during daylight ([#1148](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace/issues/1148))

    - Fix issue with the sky browser space craft pointing where it would not point correctly under some circumstances
    - Fix bug where some channels in a cluster do not set the field of view to the same value after animating ([#2425](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace/issues/2425))
    - Fix a crash that could occur in the screenspace sky browser scaling ([#2280](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace/issues/2280))
    - Fix bug that caused the master node to have no rendering output
    - Fix issue where the scale sometimes did not update the border radius in time ([#2266](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace/issues/2266))
    - Ensure browser is initialized properly before executing JavaScript
    - Make it harder to input wrong values in the interface
    - Disable hover circle per default when setting renderable and show a warning if setting to non-existing node ([#2153](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace/issues/2153))

# Breaking Changes
  - Make the check for whitespaces and dots in identifiers fatal also in non-Debug builds
  - Provide error message if a GuiPath does not start with `/` ; Automatically add / in the Profile editor.  Default initialize all paths to `/` ([#2318](https://github.com/OpenSpace/OpenSpace/issues/2318))
  - Remove Earth layers that no longer work





==============





Star fadeout
The fading happens

    when you enter the atmosphere
    when you are in the sunny area of a globe

Properties for each atmosphere are

    The angle where the sunset starts
    The angle where the sunset ends
    The percentage of the atmosphere height where the fading should happen.

Before merge, there is one edge case that should be accounted for. It is if the camera is located in an atmosphere and then uses the flyToGeo script to fly somewhere else, the renderables are not faded in as the camera has not transitet the "fading section". This could be resolved by setting the fading coefficient to 1 in the beginning of each render loop




Feature/satellites (#2185)
* Remove planet geometry and simplespheregeometry
* Only use a single TLE loading implementation
* Add caching to the satellite loader;  Add Lua function to load kepler file
* Fix RenderablePlanetProjection specification
* Add OMM loading funtion;  Remove mean motion from Kepler parameters
* Replace TLETranslation class with GPTranslation and support OMM files
* Support loading SMDB files in kepler functions
* Merge RenderableSatellites and RenderableSmallBody with RenderableOrbitalKepler
* Update submodules
* Adapt existing satellites to new OMM file type
* Remove TLE helper
* Remove SSSB shared file and adapt sssb assets


Changes to addCustomProperty (closes #2433)
 - Don't create a Lua context for an empty onChange string
 - Add support for StringListProperty
 - Add documentation
 - Add error message when a type is not supported



MRF
   Enables globe-browsing data to be cached using caching mrf's as it is loaded from the original dataset. Subsequent reads of tiles that have been cached do not query the original dataset but picks it up from the mrf data.
   Supports anything that can be used a dataset for a gdal raster but raw images such as JPGs are explicitly disallowed as they lack necessary geotransform data.

   Activated on a global scale by setting the following keys in openspace.cfg (ModuleConfigurations/GlobeBrowsing)
     MRFCacheEnabled = true,
     MRFCacheLocation = "<somepath>",
   Settings can be overriden on a per-layer basis by adding the following entries to the layer entity of an asset
      CacheSettings = { Enabled = true, Compression = "LERC", BlockSize = 512, Quality=25 },

   The following per-layer settings are available and override the global module settings:
   Enabled : enable/disable caching for this layer.
   Compression: The compression algorithm to use for tile cache storage. (JPEG, PNG, or LERC)
   BlockSize: Size of tiles in cache, should be a multiple of 2 although this is not required.
   Quality: The quality setting of the JPEG compression (when used)

   Note that heightlayers must use LERC compresison and this is the default unless overridden by a layer.

GeoJSON
   - Add the option to add geojson components to globes, from geojson files. One geojson file creates one GeoJsonComponent, which in turn may contain multiple GlobeGeometryFeatures

   - Geojson is a format that supports points, lines, and polygons. In addition to the basic functionality, extra features have been added that will long-term allow rendering the geometry needed to represent KML files (another format for geospatial geometry data). Here are links to references for both formats:
     Geojson: https://geojson.org/
      KML: https://developers.google.com/kml/documentation/kmlreference

    data/assets/examples/geojson includes some example files that I have used for testing. Any geojson file can also be added through drag-n-drop. Note however that you might need to change the AltitudeMode or HeightOffset properties for the feature to be visible
