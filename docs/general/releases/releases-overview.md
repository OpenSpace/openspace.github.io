# Version Overview
OpenSpace versions are labeled by a version number of the form `MM.mm.rr`,  where `MM` is the major version number, `mm` is the minor version number, and `rr` is the release number (see [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org)).  In some cases there may be an additional number at the end, `MM.mm.rr.bb`, where bb is the build number, but that will only be for development and testing, not for public release.

As development proceeds, some versions get tagged with names.  This table indicates which version numbers go with which tags, and some notes about each:
